**Note:**
The behavior of this function has changed between major versions 7 and 8. In version 7 there was `groupWhile` and `groupWhileTransitively`. The behavior of the two was almost identical, however the transitive function was closer to what users found intuitive about grouping. `groupWhileTransively` has been deleted, and `groupWhile` has been replaced with the version 7s `groupWhileTransitively` behavior. Furthermore the group type was changed from `List a` to the non-empty list type `(a, List a)`. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
