### 8.7.0
1. `frequencies` function, to count the number of occurences of each item in a list
2. `subsequenceNonEmpty` function, to calculate each subsequence excluding the empty list.

### 8.6.0
1. `stoppableFoldl` function and `Step` type added. A stoppable fold has better performance in cases where a fold can be terminated part way through.

### 8.5.2
1. Performance improvement to `remove` by making it tail call optimized.
2. Performance improvement to `updateAt` by only computing list head when necessary.
3. `groupsOf` and `greedyGroupsOf` are now tail call optimized, making them stack safe, but unfortunately slightly slower (small lists and groups ~20% slower).
4. Performance improvement to `isPermutationOf` by making helper functions top level, not currying functions, and putting most common `case` branches first.

### 8.5.1
1. New `isPermutationOf` implemntation in 8.5.0 did not always give the correct output. In 8.5.1 a new implementation that is both performance and correct is used.

### 8.5.0
1. `unique` and `uniqueBy` functions no longer requires comparable input arguments. This change increased performance for lists sized 0-100 elements by about 40% but decreases performance for lists sized >200 by about 35%. Seems like a worthy trade off.
2. `isPermutationOf` is vastly more performant. @lue-bird 's benchmarks show cases of being 141,000% more performant. 
3. New `reverseRange`, a more performant combination of `reverse` and `range`.

### 8.4.0
1. New function `joinOn`

### 8.3.2
1. `isInfixOf` is tail call optimized

### 8.3.1
1. `gatherWith` is tail call optimized

### 8.3.0
1. New function `findMap`

### 8.2.4
1. Speed up removeAt implementation
2. Make iterate tail recursive

### 8.2.3
1. Fixed bug in `isInfixOf` that prevented the detection of infixes after a partial infix (Issue #132)

### 8.2.0
Notes
1. `groupWhile` implementation rewritten to be tail-recursive to eliminate risk of stack overflow errors. Trade off is its about 12% slower.

Additions
1. `pairings`

### 8.1.0
Notes
1. Documentation cleaned up, and Elm verify examples implemented

Additions
1. `gatherEquals`, `gatherEqualsBy`, and `gatherWith` 
2. `maximumWith` and `minimumWith`

### 8.0.0 
Notes
1. First Elm 0.19 release

Breaking Changes
1. `replaceIf` was renamed to `setIf`
2. `unzip4` and `unzip5` were removed
3. The `(!!)` operator was removed, as Elm 0.19 no longer permits custom infix operators 
4. *Really Breaky*: The type signature of `foldl1` did not change, but the arguments did. `foldl1` takes a `a -> a -> a` as a parameter. However, before version 8.0.0 it had the shape `b -> a -> b` and now it is `a -> b -> b`.
